This application is build using React.js, jsx, context api, useContexthook, useReducerhook. I am using third party Github api, User can serach for any github user by there username. To find more about the user, click more and application will use React-router to take main page. Also, using CSS looks similar to the bootstrap to make UI look attractive.
